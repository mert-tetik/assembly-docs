/General
EAX: Called the Accumulator register. 
    It is used for I/O port access, arithmetic, interrupt calls,
    etc...

EBX : Called the Base register
    It is used as a base pointer for memory access
    Gets some interrupt return values

ECX : Called the Counter register
    It is used as a loop counter and for shifts
    Gets some interrupt values

EDX : Called the Data register
    It is used for I/O port access, arithmetic, some interrupt 
    calls.

/Segment 
CS         : Holds the Code segment in which your program runs.
             Changing its value might make the computer hang.

DS         : Holds the Data segment that your program accesses.
             Changing its value might give erronous data.

ES,FS,GS   : These are extra segment registers available for
             far pointer addressing like video memory and such.

SS         : Holds the Stack segment your program uses.
             Sometimes has the same value as DS.
             Changing its value can give unpredictable results,
             mostly data related.

/Indexes and pointers
ES:EDI EDI DI : Destination index register
                Used for string, memory array copying and setting and
                for far pointer addressing with ES

DS:ESI EDI SI : Source index register
                Used for string and memory array copying

SS:EBP EBP BP : Stack Base pointer register
                Holds the base address of the stack
                
SS:ESP ESP SP : Stack pointer register
                Holds the top address of the stack

CS:EIP EIP IP : Index Pointer
                Holds the offset of the next instruction
                It can only be read
